## About The Project

This repository explores practical applications of the Evo2 Model within potential healthcare scenarios. It provides a collection of examples and a basic framework intended to demonstrate how a system leveraging Evo2 could function for clinical analysis and decision support.

The primary goals are:

* To illustrate how the Evo2 Model can be integrated into simple clinical workflows.
* To serve as a learning resource or foundation for understanding Evo2's potential in this domain.
* To provide clear, understandable examples rather than a production-ready clinical tool.

This project focuses on demonstrating foundational concepts and patterns for using Evo2 in a clinical context.
